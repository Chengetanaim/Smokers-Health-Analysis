# Smokers health analysis

During this mini project I was looking for the impact of smoking on various factors.

# What I learnt:

- smoking increases the heart rate of a person thus has a negative impact on the well being of person
- age does not have a direct impact on the heart rate of person, you can find elder people with a normal heart, so as the same as young people
- No matter whether smoking as a habit or not, males have a lesser heart rate as compared to female which entails males are more healthier than females
- Males who don't smoke have lower cholesterol levels compared to males who smoke
- Females who don't smoke have higher cholesterol levels as compared to females who smoke
- Most smokers take between 1 and 20 cigarretes daily
